# Dynamic validation
Utility Functions: There are five validation methods:

Check if value â‰¥ 5.
Verify if a string starts with a capital letter.
Validate email format.
Ensure no special characters in a string.
Confirm a valid date format.
Validation Application: Before adding a field, the handleAddingField method uses a new function, validateField, to confirm if the entered data adheres to the required validations for its type.

Error Display: Any validation error will appear to the user at the bottom of your form.

No UI changes were made. Validations occur automatically based on the selected field type.
